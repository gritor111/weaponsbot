**WHAT WE COLLECT**
Certain Discord data is being only collected as soon as you run a command from the "fun" category.
That data is included to:
- user ID
- guild ID

"user ID" is required to store a user's progress such as "shards" (currency) and "weapons"
"guild ID" is required to store the bot's server/guild prefix

We do not store any message-related data from users and the data we store (mentioned above) is not being shared with anyone outside of discord nor is it being sold.

**OPT-OUT**
Users can opt-out of having the bot process their message content (besides the "optout" command itself) by using the "optout" command.

**DELETE DATA**
Users can request the deletion of their data within our bot via the "deletemydata" command. This will delete all the data which is bound to their user ID such as "shards, weapons, crates, ID-snipes".

Data described above is being used to show certain statistics regarding collected data and it is being planned to implement charts anytime soon.
Our main goal is to find and show off rare weapons and share them with our users.
Users can currently reach out to us, the "weapons" bot developers, if they:
- have concerns about the bot or wish to remove their data (shards and custom weapons).
